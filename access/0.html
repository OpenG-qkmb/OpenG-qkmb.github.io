Info:<br>Nightcar Union is a terrorist organization initiated by Y.  This organization has more than 10 people. Its purpose is to write homework at night and come to other bedrooms.  The above behaviors are prohibited but members of this organization completely violate them.  Everyone in this organization has its own call sign. In the evening, the commander-in-chief, Mr. Y, arranges the time for members to write homework in the evening and the time and place to go to other bedrooms without permission.  Members usually make strange noises when they are at the gate, making people sleepless all night.  Some members come to the door to communicate commands and wake up other members to perform tasks.  This is the largest terrorist organization of C School.
